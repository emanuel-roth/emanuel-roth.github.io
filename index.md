	<p>From September 2024, I am a PhD student of <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~jmartens/">Johan Martens</a> at the University of Edinburgh. I was previously at the University of Heidelberg, where I completed my masters under the supervision of <a href="https://matematiflo.github.io/">Florent Schaffhauser</a>.</p>

<div id="describe-text">
	<p>In 2025, I thought about nonabelian Hodge theory, moduli spaces of Higgs bundles, vector bundles, and principal bundles, along with their stability conditions. Now, I think about complentary polyhedra to generalize Jordan-Hölder filtrations to parahoric Higgs torsors. </p>

I am funded by the <a href="https://www.agq-cdt.org/">EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Algebra, Geometry, and Quantum Fields</a>.

	<p>My masters thesis was on canonical reductions of principal bundles, which is now a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17371v1">preprint</a> with Florent Schaffhauser. It explains how Harder-Narasimhan filtrations of vector bundles can be generalized to principal bundles, and works out some  examples (symplectic and special orthogonal versions).</p>
</div>

<div id="describe-text">
	<p>My bachelors thesis was on <a href="/assets/bachelor.pdf">the Mitchell embedding theorem</a>, explaining how the Yoneda embedding can be used to embed certain abelian categories into module categories.</p>
